# README

## Repository Content
1. README.md file -- explains the contents, setup and running the R script
2. CodeBook.md -- Details on variables, data and transformations used in the script
3. run\_analysis.R -- main script for submission for this Course Project
4. volunteer\_activity\_averages.txt -- tidy data set for part 5, containing average of each column grouped by activity and volunteer ID

## Running the R script
The dataset for this exercise is a few MB big, so it is not uploaded to this repository. Besides, it is publicly available at the following URL:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The following steps must be taken to run the R script:

1.Download the dataset zip file and unzip it into the top folder of this repository, i.e. same folder as where run\_analysis resides.

2.The name of the unzipped folder should be "UCI HAR Dataset.zip". **Rename** it to "dataset", partly because it is easier to type out, and partly because I hate spaces in directory names (if you use Linux, you'll understand why!)

3.If you are running the script from command line, just type "Rscript run\_analysis.R" into the terminal. If RStudio, source the script when in the right folder.

**NOTE**: I use dplyr package, please have that installed if you don't have it.

Below is the project description, as on the Coursera course page:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

 You should create one R script called run\_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

 Good luck!
